Polygon Transformer
===================

This is just a Unity Game Engine test/prototype with an object being pushed around with the "power" of switching between polygons.

* Use w, a, s, d or the arrow keys to navigate.
* Use the space bar to jump.
* Left-click to switch polygons (Only sphere and cube are available).
